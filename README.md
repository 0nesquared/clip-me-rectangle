# clip-me-rectangle
Implementation of the Sutherland Polygon Clipping for any convex polygon, and a clip rectangle.

To run, one just needs to type the command **make run** in the terminal with the file directory open.
The data file needs to have the clip rectangle as the last entry in order to work.
Besides, the glut package should already be installed in the system beforehand.

To run the program for a different data file, one can just change the __FILENAME__ parameter value in the Makefile.

To delete the output files generated, one can run the command **make clean**
